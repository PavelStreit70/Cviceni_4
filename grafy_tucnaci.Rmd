## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

#Get the structure of data, number of rows and number of columns

str(data)
nrow(data)
ncol(data)

# How many NA values are in total in the dataset?

sum(is.na(NA))

# Remove rows containing NA values. How many rows are left now?

data <- na.omit(data)
nrow(data)

# What islands do these penguins live on?

levels(data$island)
table(data$island)

#What is the mean body mass of male penguins?

data %>% 
  filter(sex == "male") %>% 
  summarise(mean(body_mass_g)) 

# Compute maximum flipper length for each of the penguin species

data %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(max = max(flipper_length_mm))

# Compute how many penguins lived on each of the islands in each year

data %>% 
  group_by(island, year) %>% 
  summarise(sum = sum())

# (HW) Is the minimal bill length of Adelie species higher than Gentoo?

#min(data$bill_length_mm[data$species == "Adelie"]) > min(data$bill_length_mm[data$species == "Gentoo"])

data %>%
  filter(species %in% c("Adelie", "Gentoo")) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(min_bill_length = min(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
  

# (HW) On which island do more female than male penguins live?

data %>% 
  group_by(island, sex) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "sex", values_from = "n") %>%
  filter(female > male)
